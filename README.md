COBOL samples
I assume that you know the basics of 3GL programming.
Won't show what are structures: decision, repetition, code blocks...
Will not show you how to add, subtract, multiply or divide.
Enjoy!

It works like an army. Divisions and sections with their place and role.
- Identification division.
- Environment division.
- Data division.
- Procedure division.

It looks like plain english. 
- Sentences with names and verbs.
- Punctuation signs are important.
- Program data is described in detail.
- Program instructions are then specified.
